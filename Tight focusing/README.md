## Towards ML-Based Diagnostics of Laser–Plasma Interactions

We report on the development of ML-based methods for extraction of information that is missing from experimental results, namely, the preplasma scale length and the pulse carrier envelope phase, from the spectrum of XUV radiation generated in the interaction. We simulated a laser pulse angularly incident on a solid plasma target with a pre-plasma length.

The deep learning model has shown good results in restoring the laser-plasma interaction parameters. We have explored the use of data preprocessing and augmentation to improve the accuracy of the model. We also considered training scenarios for the model with noise. An approach with a gradual increase in noise amplitude is considered for tuning the tolerance of a deep learning model.
